### **Hello**!

My name is Trevor Gam and I am currently a Computer Science major at [UC Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu/). I have a huge interest in Embedded Systems and Operating Systems, and I plan to specialize in the [Systems and Software](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#text) and [Networking](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#text) programs offered by my university. 

Since discovering my passion for programming, I’ve focused on small, independent projects to deepen my understanding of software development. I’m excited to apply the skills I’ve gained and contribute to larger-scale projects.
