### **Hello**!

My name is Trevor Gam and I am currently a third-year Computer Science major at [UC Irvine](https://ics.uci.edu/). I have a huge interest in learning about Embedded Systems and Operating Systems, and I (tentatively) plan to specialize in the [Systems and Software](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#text) and [Networking](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#text) programs offered by my university. 

In the brief period of time since I became passionate about programming, I have dedicated my focus to small-scale, independent projects to allow myself the opportunity of grasping the intricacies of developing projects. I am extremely excited to use the skills I have cultivated to contribute to larger-scale projects.
